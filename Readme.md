Hi my name Chris, I am going to build the personal finance tracker from scratch.

Idealy is using Nodejs Apollo Server to build BE, React Native (Expo) to build the mobile application.


Todo:

## Server

[x] - init the server with apollo server

[x] - implement db postgres using drizzle orm

[x] - implement authentication

[ ] - implement CRUD accounts, transactions

[ ] - more....


## Mobile

[x] - init expo project - reset

[x] - setup design system ui components.

[x] - integrate with apollo server using apollo client

[ ] - implement authentication

[ ] - implement CRUD accounts, transactions 

I am using bun instead of npm or yarn

In this video, I am going to create the mobile appication with Expo
